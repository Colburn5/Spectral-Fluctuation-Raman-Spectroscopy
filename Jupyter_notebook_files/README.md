These are the jupyter notebook files that were used for the simulations
jupyter_photons_code_FI.ipynb contains all the functions that create the base data files and run the data analysis required to compute correlation functions for one simulated photon stream at one stage position.
jupyter_pcfs_code_FI.ipynb contains all the functions that run the data analysis once a correlation function has been computed for each interferometer stage position.
Simulation_function-definition.ipynb defines all of the functions required to simulate the SFRS experiemnt including things like assigning photon arrival times and energies. 

jupyter_photons_code_FI.ipynb and jupyter_pcfs_code_FI.ipynb can be used with real data taken from the Swabian TimeTagger or data simulated from Simulation_function-definition.ipynb
